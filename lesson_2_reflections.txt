What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, it creates a .git directory that contains all the metadata of the repository. We need to do it if we want to have a control version of our files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Is different because the staging area is tracked by the git protocol. The waking directory will hace files that are not related to the repository nor git protocol.
